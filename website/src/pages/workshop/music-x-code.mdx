# Live-coding with Strudel

This is a beginners' Strudel worksheet designed for Peckham Digital's 2025 Music x Code programme. Thanks to Lucy Cheesman for providing the foundations of this workshop!

The purpose of this guide is to start you on your live-coding journey with Strudel. There are many different ways to do live-coding, and the approach outlined here is by no means the best or only approach. However, we hope that it will provide you with the tools necessary to start live-coding music for yourself.

Most of all, we encourage you to experiment - there is no right or wrong way to live-code!

# Getting started

We can write and run code interactively in this worksheet - press the play button or hit `Ctrl`+`Enter`. Hit the stop button or `Ctrl`+`.` to stop the sound.

Later you can move on to using the main Strudel editor (click `go to REPL` in the top right), but it works in the same way as the code snippets on this page.

Feel free to edit any of the code you see - you can always refresh the page to get the original worksheet back.

# The basics

This is how we write a basic pattern in Strudel.

- `sound` is a function that tells strudel we want to play a sound
- Inside the speech marks we write the names of the sounds we want to play.


<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("bd hh sd oh")`} dirt />

<Box>
These short names correspond to different parts of a standard drum kit:

`bd` = Bass drum

`sd` = Snare drum

`hh` = Hi-hat (closed)

`oh` = Hi-hat (open)
</Box>

- You play the sound by pressing the play button (or `Ctrl`+`Enter`)
- You can stop the sound by hitting `Ctrl` and `.`
- The sounds have to load, so you might not hear them at first!

What happens if we put more sounds in the pattern?

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("bd hh sd oh hh bd oh sd")`} dirt />

Even more?

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("bd hh sd oh hh bd oh sd hh sn oh bd")`} dirt />

The pattern becomes much faster and denser - this is because Strudel has a consistent 'cycle' of time running in the background. You might find that adding `._spiral()` to the end of your code helps you to visualise this:

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`
sound("bd hh sd oh")
._spiral()
`} dirt />

Any sounds in the pattern will run within that cycle, and Strudel will try to space them evenly in time.
(Unless we tell it not to... we'll learn how to do that later).

This means that the pulse of the pattern is dictated by the number of elements:

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("hh bd sd")`} dirt />

vs.

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("hh bd hh cp hh bd hh")`} dirt />

Later on when we learn how to play multiple patterns at once this gives us some opportunities to play with rhythm.

Now try writing your own pattern with some of these other sounds:

`insect wind jazz metal east crow casio space numbers`

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={``} dirt />

## Mininotation

The green writing inside the speech marks has its own set of rules. We call this the 'mininotation' and it's the core of how Strudel generates patterns.

We can speed things up with `*`

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("hh")`} dirt />

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("hh*4")`} dirt />

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("hh*32")`} dirt />

Or slow them down with `/` - the snare only sounds every other cycle:

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("bd sd/2") `} dirt />

We can choose different sounds from a set using `:`. The computer starts counting at `0`, so `casio:0` is the same as `casio`.

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("casio casio casio casio")`} dirt />

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("casio casio:1 casio casio:5")`} dirt />

An alternative way to do this is with `n`:

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`n("0 1 0 5").sound("casio")`} dirt />

We can add a rest using `~` or `-`:

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`n("0 1 ~ 5").sound("casio")`} dirt />

We can create more variation with sub-sequences.
We do this by breaking our steps down into mini patterns using `[]`:

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("bd sd bd hh")`} dirt />

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("bd sd [bd cp] [hh oh]")`} dirt />

Let's have a look at how that looks visually:

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("bd sd [bd cp] [hh oh]")`} dirt punchcard />

You can also use `*` or `/` to speed up or slow down sub-sequences:

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("bd sd [bd cp]/2 [hh oh]*2")`} dirt punchcard />

You can nest sequences within sequences for dense patterns:

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("bd bd [hh hh] [hh [hh hh]]")`} dirt punchcard />

You can also use `<>` to play events once per cycle:

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("bd bd <hh cp> sd")`} dirt punchcard />

Let's add some easy randomness using `?`.
Putting `?` after a sound means there is a 50% probability that the sound will play.

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("hh*8?")`} dirt punchcard/>

# Selecting functions

Strudel has a _lot_ of functions (To check them out click `go to REPL > Reference`) - this can be a problem for live performances:

- it's not practical to memorise all these
- in the moment on stage we want to simplify our decision making
- some of them require complex syntax and/or a lot of typing

So let's choose some favourites to work with. I'm going to go through a few of mine here and how I use them, but if you're more experienced you might have your own ideas!

## Working with short sounds

Let's start by writing some simple patterns and slowly adding complexity.

`{}` - for combining patterns with different numbers of elements:

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`$: sound("{bd bd/1 bd/2 bd/3, ~ ~ hh [~ cp] hh*3}")`} dirt />

[Euclidean rhythms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_rhythm)

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`$: sound("{bd bd/1 bd/2 bd/3, ~ ~ hh [~ cp] hh*3}")

$: sound("metal(3,8)")`} dirt />

`hurry`

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`$: sound("{bd bd/1 bd/2 bd/3, ~ ~ hh [~ cp] hh*3}")

$: sound("metal(3,8)")
.hurry("<1 1 2 4>")`} dirt />

Density (aka `fast`/`slow`)

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`$: sound("{bd bd/1 bd/2 bd/3, ~ ~ hh [~ cp] hh*3}")
.fast("1 <1 2>")

$: sound("metal(3,8)")
.hurry("<1 1 2 4>")`} dirt />

You'll notice here that we're using `$:` before each `sound` - this lets us play multiple sounds within the same block of code.

### Exercise

Try writing some patterns using very simple functions and just a few short sounds.

Tips:

- You can use the functions/sounds I've used above, or use some others if you know them
- Try to make something you like the sound of _without writing a lot of code_
- Don't be afraid to delete and start again - imagine you are learning piano and need to practice your scales!
- Try to really limit the number of sounds for now
- If you really want to try some other sounds, how about using some of these: `insect wind jazz metal east crow casio space numbers`
  <MiniRepl client:visible tune={`// your code here`} dirt />

## Working with patterns

Next we'll try manipulating the patterns we've described above.

`iter` cycles through the pattern starting at different points, it's great for adding variety over time

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`$: sound("{bd bd/1 bd/2 bd/3, ~ ~ hh [~ cp] hh*3}")
.fast("1 <1 2>")

$: sound("metal(3,8)")
.hurry("<1 1 2 4>")
.iter("4")`} dirt />

`jux` lets us apply a transformation in one speaker only giving us a stereo effect

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`$: sound("{bd bd/1 bd/2 bd/3, ~ ~ hh [~ cp] hh*3}")
.fast("1 <1 2>")

$: sound("metal(3,8)")
.hurry("<1 1 2 4>")
.jux(iter("4"))`} dirt />

`sometimes`/`often`/`every`/etc lets us apply transformations only some of the time

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`$: sound("{bd bd/1 bd/2 bd/3, ~ ~ hh [~ cp] hh*3}")
.fast("1 <1 2>")

$: sound("metal(3,8)")
.hurry("<0.5 1 1 2>")
.jux(iter("4"))
.every(2, fast(2))`} dirt />

`chunk` is another good way to add interest over time - it divides the patterns into _n_ chunks and applies a transformation to a different chunk each cycle

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`$: sound("{bd bd/1 bd/2 bd/3, ~ ~ hh [~ cp] hh*3}")
.fast("1 <1 2>")

$: sound("metal(3,8)")
.hurry("<0.5 1 1 2>")
.jux(iter("4"))
.every(2, fast(2))

$: sound("wind\*8?")
.legato("1")
.chunk(4, hurry("<2 0.5>"))`} dirt />

The last function I want to look at here is `off`, which can be used to add another layer of complexity to your pattern.

Here, the pattern is delayed by 1/8th of a cycle, made faster with `speed(2)`, then played back on top of the original pattern:

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`$: sound("bd cp [hh oh] bd")
.fast("1 <1 2>")
.off(1/8, x=>x.speed(2))`} dirt />

<Box>
Note: The second argument to `off`, `x=>x.speed(2)`, is known as a lamdba function. Essentially, it's telling `off` to apply `.speed(2)` to the original pattern.
</Box>

### Exercise

Take your pattern from the first exercise and try applying some pattern manipulations.

Tips:

- You can use the functions I've used above, or use some others if you know them
- The process is to start with something simple and iteratively add complexity
- Again, try to limit the sounds you're using to just a few samples
- Don't worry too much about your code, just play about with different combinations and see if you can find something you like the sound of!

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`// your code here`} dirt />

## Working with longer sounds

Longer samples require a different approach, and can cause us some problems in on-the-fly performances if we're not careful.

Strudel doesn't come with many long samples so we're going to load some in from the internet for these examples - for more info on this, see `Making sound > Samples > Loading Custom Samples`.

`loopAt` lets us sync a sample to a given number of cycles. This is especially helpful for working with loops:

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`samples({ rhodes: 'https://cdn.freesound.org/previews/132/132051_316502-lq.mp3' })

$: sound("rhodes")
.loopAt(2)`} dirt />

As well as a basic loop we can play about with the parameters of `loopAt`:

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`samples({ rhodes: 'https://cdn.freesound.org/previews/132/132051_316502-lq.mp3' })
  
$: sound("rhodes*4")
.loopAt("<4 <1 2>>")
.cut(1)
.iter(4)
.chop("<1 1 2 4>")

$: sound("{bd bd/1 bd/2 bd/3, ~ ~ hh [~ cp] hh}")
.every(4, (slow(2)))`} dirt />

Here, `cut` is used to stop playing the sample as soon as the next sample is triggered.

An alternative to `loopAt` is `fit`, which will fit a sample to its event duration:

<MiniRepl
  client:visible
  tune={`samples('github:yaxu/clean-breaks')
s("amen/4").fit().chop(16)`}
  punchcard
/>

This fits the break into 4 cycles and chops it into 16 pieces.
The chops are not audible yet, because we're not doing any manipulation. So let's add randomized doubling with `ply(2)` and reversing with `mul(speed(-1))`:

<MiniRepl
  client:visible
  tune={`samples('github:yaxu/clean-breaks')
s("amen/4").fit().chop(16).cut(1)
.sometimesBy(.5, ply(2))
.sometimesBy(.25, mul(speed(-1)))`}
  punchcard
/>

If we want to specify the order of samples, we can replace `chop` with `slice`:

<MiniRepl
  client:visible
  tune={`samples('github:yaxu/clean-breaks')
s("amen/4").fit()
  .slice(8, "<0 1 2 3 4*2 5 6 [6 7]>*2")
  .cut(1).rarely(ply("2"))`}
  punchcard
/>

If we use `splice` instead of `slice`, the speed adjusts to the duration of the event:

<MiniRepl
  client:visible
  tune={`samples('github:yaxu/clean-breaks')
s("amen")
  .splice(8, "<0 1 2 3 4*2 5 6 [6 7]>*2")
  .cut(1).rarely(ply("2"))`}
  punchcard
/>

Note that we don't need `fit`, because `splice` will do that by itself.

### Exercise

Try creating a pattern using some longer samples.
Tips:

- Feel free to use the functions above, or if you know some others then give them a go
- Can you create complementary pattern of short sounds? Use your ear to decide what sounds good
- Iterate on your patterns using the techniques you know
- Think about chaining together simple functions to build complexity over time
- Again, try to really limit the number of sounds you're using - this is about getting used to what you can do with the functions.
- If you're feeling confident try to do it without looking at the reference
- Remember - if you don't like where it's going, delete it and start again!
- Even if you like where it's going try to get used to deleting and re-creating your patterns
- Now we've loaded in the TidalCycles samples here are a few more longer sounds you might want to play about with: `pebbles break foo birds`

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`
samples('github:tidalcycles/dirt-samples')

//your code here`} dirt />

# Effects

You can use effects to change the character of your sounds. For example, `hpf` applies a high-pass filter, which cuts out the lower frequencies of a sound:

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`
sound("bd bd [hh oh] sd")
.hpf("100 1000 5000 7500")`} dirt />

Similarly, `lpf` cuts out the higher frequencies:

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`
sound("bd bd [hh oh] sd")
.lpf("20 100 1000 5000")`} dirt />

Note that `lpf` and `hpf` work best with values in the range 20 - 20000, which is the range of frequencies typically audible to the human ear.

You can use `pan` to move the sound between the left and right channels, where 0 is the left channel and 1 is the right channel:

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`
sound("bd bd [hh oh] sd")
.pan("0 0.25 0.75 1")`} dirt />

You can create an echo effect using `delay`, along with a value from 0 to 1 to control the level of the delay signal:

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`
s("cp cp").delay("<0 .25 .5 1>")`} dirt />

You can use `delaytime` to change the speed of the delay:

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`
s("cp cp").delay(.25).delaytime("<.125 .25 .5 1>")`} dirt />

You can apply a reverb effect with `room`:

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`
s("cp cp").room("<.125 .25 .5 1>")`} dirt />

# Signals

Until now, we've been using numbers to control our patterns. However, you can also use signals which change smoothly over time.

For example, you can use `saw` to create a signal that rises smoothly from a lower value to a higher value:

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`
s("cp cp").delay(.25).lpf(saw.range(500, 5000).slow(4))`} dirt />

Here, `.slow(4)` means that it takes four cycles for the signal to reach it's maximum value.

You can also use signals with different shapes - try using `tri` or `square` instead of `saw` and see how that changes the sound!
