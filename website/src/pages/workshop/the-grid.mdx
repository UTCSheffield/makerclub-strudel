# The grid (and beyond)

I love grids! But they can be a bit omnipresent in Western music. How can we look beyond them?

## Into the grid

We can break down and mess up 'cells' in the grid

### tuples

Triplets and friends, with `[]` and `@`!

### syncopation

![](/img/metrical-weight.png)

Syncopation is about emphasing 'weak' beats

`press` / `pressBy` can be helpful with this!

## Beyond the grid

We can also loosen things up a bit

- Add some 'swing', e.g. with `early` / `late`
- Try out the new `euclidish` function
