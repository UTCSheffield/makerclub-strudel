## Getting started

We can write and run code interactively in this worksheet.

Feel free to edit any of the code you see - you can always refresh the page to get the original worksheet back.

Later we'll move to the main Strudel interface - click `Go to REPL` in the top right to take a look. The main interface gives us more space to code, as well as lots of code examples, documentation, and other useful information.

This is how we write a basic pattern in Strudel.

- We start with `$:` to open a channel
- `sound` is a command that tells strudel we want to play a sound
- Inside the speech marks we write the names of the sounds we want to play

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`$: sound("bd hh sd oh")`} dirt punchcard />

- You play the sound by pressing the play button or hitting `ctrl` and `enter`
- You can stop the sound by hitting `ctrl` and `.` (for some people this doesn't work...) or pressing the stop button
- The sounds have to load so you might not hear them first time round

The more elements we put into the pattern the faster and denser it becomes - this is because Strudel has a consistent 'cycle' of time running in the background.
Any sounds in the pattern will run within that cycle, and Strudel will try to space them evenly in time.
(Unless we tell it not to... we'll learn how to do that later).

Even more?

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("bd hh sd oh hh bd oh sd hh sn oh bd")`} dirt punchcard />

This means that the pulse of the pattern is dictated by the number of elements - which gives us some nice opportunities to play with rhythm.

<MiniRepl
  client:visible
  tune={`$: sound("hh bd sd")
$: sound("jazz jazz cp jazz")`}
  dirt
  punchcard
/>

### Exercise - 5 mins

Now try writing your own pattern with some of these other sounds:

`insect wind jazz metal east crow casio space num`

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`//your code here`} dirt punchcard />

## Pattern notation

The green writing inside the speech marks has its own set of rules for defining patterns. We call this the 'mininotation' and it's the core of coding in Strudel.

We can speed things up with `*`

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("hh*16 oh")`} dirt punchcard />

Or slow them down with `/` - the clap only sounds every other cycle:

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("bd cp/2") `} dirt />

We can choose different sounds from a set using `:`. The computer starts counting at `0`, so `casio:0` is the same as `casio`.

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("casio casio:1 casio casio:5")`} dirt punchcard />

We can add a rest using `~`

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("casio casio:1 ~ casio:5")`} dirt punchcard />

We can create more variation with sub-sequences.
We do this by breaking our steps down into mini patterns using `[]`

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("bd sd bd hh")`} dirt punchcard />

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("bd sd [bd cp] [hh oh]")`} dirt punchcard />

You can nest sequences within sequences for dense patterns

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("[[bd [bd bd bd bd]] bd sd] [bd cp]")`} dirt punchcard />

We can also schedule events across multiple cycles using `<>`

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("casio <[hh cp] casio:1> ~ casio:5")`} dirt punchcard />

Let's add some easy randomness using `?`.
Putting `?` after a sound means there is a 50% probability that the sound will play.

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("hh*8?")`} dirt punchcard />

### Exercise: 10 minutes

- Create your own patterns using the mininotation
- Start with something simple and then add complexity bit by bit
- Try to use all the elements outlined above
- Don't be precious about your code - if you're not happy then delete it and start again!
- Imagine you are learning a traditional instrument - repetition and practicing the same things over and over again is key :)

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`//your code here`} dirt punchcard />

## Chaining commands

Let's learn about chaining commands together. This is how we start to make more complex patterns.

Let's start with a command called `note` - this lets us re-pitch samples or choose different notes if we're using a synth. This is really helpful if we want to create melodies.

We connect commands together with `.`

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`note("0 1 0 5").sound("casio")`} dirt punchcard />

We can chain commands together in any order, however, because Strudel always takes the rhythm from the first pattern, we need to be careful how we do this:

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("casio").note("0 1 0 5")`} dirt />

There's another way of selecting samples, using a command called `n` - this gives us a bit more flexibility in writing patterns.

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`n("0 1 0 5").sound("casio")`} dirt punchcard />

This saves us a bit of typing, and makes things easier to edit as we go.

We can combine as many commands as we like:

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`note("0 1 0 5").sound("casio").n("<0 2>")`} dirt punchcard />

And we can make use of all the mininotation we learned above in the `note` or `n` pattern

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`n("0 1*3 <0 [~ 7]> 5").sound("casio <space jazz>")`} dirt punchcard />

Strudel does its best to map the two patterns together, based on when each event in the pattern starts.

### Exercise - 10 minutes

- Try writing a pattern using two or more commands
- Try combining different pattern structures in your commands and see how they map together

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`//your code here`} dirt punchcard />

## Pattern transformation

Let's explore some ways of creating more complex patterns.

### Custom samples

But first we can load in some custom samples - these were recorded by the Society of Explorers at Site Gallery during a project I did earlier in the year.

We need to load the samples in from the internet using the `samples` function.

Then we can call them in the same way as usual.

The samples are in four banks:

- `per` (23 sounds) - these are percussive samples
- `tone` (28 sounds) - these are tonal samples
- `text` (33 sounds) - these are textural samples
- `long` (19 sounds) - these are longer samples (we handle these slightly differently - we'll come to that later)

Remember if you re-load the worksheet you may have to run this chunk again to load the samples back in.

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`samples('github:heavy-lifting/soc-ex')

n("1 5 8 23").sound("tone")`} dirt />
Let's start with a simple drum beat:

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`n("9 10*2 9 [~ 2]").sound("per")`} dirt />

We can slow that down with `slow()`:

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`n("9 10*2 9 [~ 2]").sound("per").slow(2)`} dirt />

Or speed it up with `fast()`:

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`n("9 10*2 9 [~ 2]").sound("per").fast(2)`} dirt />

You can change the number in brackets after `fast` or `slow` to change how much we speed up or slow down by.
You can even pattern that number using the mininotation!

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`n("9 10*2 9 [~ 2]").sound("per").slow("1 2")`} dirt />

It might seem like something a bit weird is happening here - basically Strudel is switching between two versions of the pattern, the normal version and the slow version.
It can be a bit hard to get your head round exactly what's happening sometimes, but as long as you're happy with the sound I don't think it matters too much.

Let's think about some other kinds of patterns - `rev()` lets us play a pattern backwards:

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`n("0 <[1 2] 3> ~ 4").sound("tone")`} dirt />

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`n("0 <[1 2] 3> ~ 4").sound("tone").rev()`} dirt />

Or we can use `every()` to apply a transformation every so many cycles:

Notice here we are combining the functions in a different way. The `every()` function takes two arguments, which are separated by a comma. The first one is the number of cycles to trigger the transformation, the second one is the transformation.

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`n("0 <[1 2] 3> ~ 4").sound("tone").every(4, rev())`} dirt />

We can pass any function as the second argument to the `every()` function:

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`n("0 <[6 7] 8> ~ 10").sound("tone").every(4, slow(2))`} dirt />

Or we can do something similar with `sometimes` which will apply a transformation with 50% likelihood:

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`n("9 10*2 9 [~ 2]").sound("per").sometimes(rev)`} dirt />

This can sound quite confusing as it's randomly jumping between the forwards and backwards versions of the pattern. We can use `someCycles()` instead to choose once per cycle.

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`n("9 10*2 9 [~ 2]").sound("per").someCycles(rev)`} dirt />

`Iter` starts the pattern at a different point each cycle, giving us a rotational pattern:

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`n("1 2 3 4").sound("num").iter(4).slow(2)`} dirt punchcard />

This can lead to some nice variation across time:

<MiniRepl
  client:visible
  tune={`//drums:
$: n("9 10*2 9 [~ 2]").sound("per").every(3, rev)
//synth:
$: n("0 <[6 7] 8> ~ 10")
.sound("tone")
.room("<0 0 1 2>")
.pan("0 1")
.vowel("<a o p>")
.iter(4)`}
  dirt
/>

Finally, we can apply a transformation in one speaker only using `jux`:
(although for some reason this isn't working as expected...)

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`n("9 10*2 <7 9> [~ 2]").sound("per").jux(rev)`} dirt />

### Exercise - 10 minutes

- Try writing some simple patterns and then applying transformations.
- Remember - start simple and make iterative changes
- Try creating some patterns in the parameters of your commands using the mininotation
- If you're feeling brave, use `$:` to run multiple patterns at the same time

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`//your code here`} dirt punchard />

# Making it sound more interesting

If we play a long sample it will be triggered every cycle and so we will end up with an overlapping effect.
This can sound good, but it's not always what we're looking for.
Here are a few functions to help you work with longer sounds.

`loopAt` will loop the sample at a set number of cycles

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("long").loopAt("1")`} dirt />

We can of course pattern that too:

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`n("3 4 5 6").sound("long").loopAt("<1 2>")`} dirt />

`slice` cuts the sample into equal slices and then lets us pattern how they are played back:

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`n("3").sound("long").slice(8, "5 3 1 [~ 2*2]").iter(4)`} dirt />

### Exercise - 5 minutes

- Trying writing a drum beat and then work with a longer sample on top using `loopAt` or `slice`
- Some longer samples and loops can be found in `defender galaga qbert pacman nintendo frogger track`

<MiniRepl
  client:visible
  tune={`// your code here
// drums
$: 
// longer samples
$: `}
  dirt
  punchard
/>

## Effects

Ok, let's try adding some effects.

The `vowel` effect is a kind of filter.

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`n("6 <[9 7] 6> ~ 5").sound("tone:3").legato(1).vowel("a")`} dirt punchcard />

We can use mini-notation to create a pattern in the effect:

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`n("6 <[9 7] 6> ~ 5").sound("tone:3").legato(1).vowel("<a e>")`} dirt punchcard />

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`n("6 <[9 7] 6> ~ 5").sound("tone:3").legato(1).vowel("a e i")`} dirt punchcard />

Most effects take a pattern of numbers. `pan` moves the signal left and right:

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`n("6 <[9 7] 6> ~ 5").sound("tone:3").legato(1).pan("0 1")`} dirt punchcard />

`room` adds reverb:

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sd("6 <[9 7] 6> ~ 5").sound("tone:3").legato(1).room("<0 0 1 2>")`} dirt punchcard />

We can chain effects together:

<MiniRepl
  client:visible
  tune={`n("6 <[9 7] 6> ~ 5").sound("tone:3").legato(1).room("<0 0 1 2>").pan("0 1").vowel("<a o i>")`}
  dirt
  punchcard
/>

### Exercise - 5 minutes

- Take one of your patterns from above and try adding some effects
- Try pattening the effect parameters

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`//your code here`} dirt punchard />

## Bonus content:

### Polyrhythm/polymeter

Health warning: I may have got these mixed up...

We can use `stack` or `[,]` to create polyrhythmic structures - in this case patterns of three over four

<MiniRepl
  client:visible
  tune={`$: n("10 11 14 17").sound("per")
$: n("12 18 22").sound("tone")`}
  dirt
/>

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("[per per per, text text]")`} dirt punchcard />

We can use `{,}` to create polymetrical structures - the elements of the pattern _after_ the comma will follow the same pulse as those _before_ the comma
This can give us a sense of rotation over time.

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("{per per:6 [~ per:14] per:27, text:17 ~ ~ ~ tone:29}")`} dirt />

### Euclidian rhythm

We can use brackets after the name of a sound to define a Euclidian rhythm - Strudel will try to space the first number of events over the second number of steps:

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("per:18(3,8)")`} dirt />

We can rotate the pattern so it starts on a different step by using a third argument:

<MiniRepl client:visible tune={`sound("tone:17(3,8,<0 2>)")`} dirt />

Try experimenting with different values.

If you've made it this far then well done!!! You can graduate to the main REPL and keep practicing - click `go to REPL` in the top right :)
