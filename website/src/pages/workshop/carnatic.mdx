# Getting Inspired by Carnatic Rhythms

Strudel (via its predecessor TidalCycles) is partly inspired by another system called the [Bol Processor](https://bolprocessor.org/), which was originally created to notate North Indian, Hindustani music of the _tabla_ drums. That's why Strudel likes to make you think in terms of rhythmic cycles which are prevalent in Indian music.

Algorithmic music has a particularly strong connection to _South_ Indian, Carnatic music traditions, which feature intricate rhythms featuring geometric patterns and numberical transformations.

Here's an example from Manjunath B C and his son Skanda:

This is in the _Konnakol_ tradition, where performers perform vocal rhythms using groups of syllables mostly related to the sounds of the mridangam drum. It goes fast, but they start with:

```
Tha . Thakadimi
Tha . Tha . Thakadimi
Tha . Tha . Tha . Thakadimi
Tarikita Tarikita
```

In the above `.` is a gap, so for example `Tha . Tha .` has a count of four. Notice the repetition of 'Ta' increasing from 1 to 3. They then repeat with the `Tha` replaced with `Dhi`, `Thom` and finally `Nam`:

```
Dhi . Takadimi
Dhi . Dhi . Takadimi
Dhi . Dhi . Dhi . Takadimi
Tarikita Tarikita
```

```
Thom . Takadimi
Thom . Thom . Takadimi
Thom . Thom . Thom . Takadimi
Tarikita Tarikita
```

```
Nam . Takadimi
Nam . Nam . Takadimi
Nam . Nam . Nam . Takadimi
Tarikita Tarikita
```

From there, they recite all the same syllables, but in different orders creating different patterns. For example, if we notate the above structure in terms of the number of repetitions: `123`, then `321` would be:

```
Tha . Tha . Tha . Thakadimi
Tha . Tha . Thakadimi
Tha . Thakadimi
Tarikita Tarikita
```

If you click or clap along every fourth syllable (including the gaps), you can feel the rhythm structures move around creating different syncopations (the use of 'weak' off-beats), but the same groups of four always add up to 16 claps/clicks (this fits the Indian metrical concept of _Tala_, in this case the _Adi Tala_).

So from these two possibilities ...

```
   Tha  Dhi  Thom  Nam
1. 123  123  123  123
2. 321  321  321  321
```

... there are a lot more possibilities that Manjunath and Skanda explore in their video:

```
3. 123 321 123 321
4. 321 123 321 123
5. 222 222 222 222
6. 111 222 333 123
7. 333 222 111 321
```

_Special thanks to B C Manjunath for sharing and explaining this pattern to me._
