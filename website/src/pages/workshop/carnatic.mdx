# Getting Inspired by Carnatic Rhythms

Strudel (via its predecessor TidalCycles) is partly inspired by another system called the [Bol Processor](https://bolprocessor.org/), which was originally created to notate North Indian, Hindustani music of the _tabla_ drums. That's why Strudel likes to make you think in terms of rhythmic cycles which are prevalent in Indian music.

Algorithmic music has a particularly strong connection to _South_ Indian, Carnatic music traditions, which feature intricate rhythms featuring geometric patterns and numberical transformations.

Here's an example from Manjunath B C and his son Skanda. It's incredibly fast, but lets try to understand it!

This is in the _Konnakol_ tradition, where performers perform vocal rhythms using groups of syllables mostly related to the sounds of the mridangam drum. It goes fast, but they start with:

```
Tha - Thakadimi
Tha - Tha - Thakadimi
Tha - Tha - Tha - Thakadimi
Tarikita Tarikita
```

In the above the dashes (like '`-`') stand for a gap, so for example `Tha - Tha -` has a count of four. Notice the repetition of 'Tha' increasing from 1 to 3 over the first three lines. 

They then repeat the same structure, but with the `Tha` replaced with `Dhi`, `Thom` and finally `Nam`:

```
Dhi - Takadimi
Dhi - Dhi . Takadimi
Dhi - Dhi - Dhi - Takadimi
Tarikita Tarikita
```

```
Thom - Takadimi
Thom - Thom - Takadimi
Thom - Thom - Thom - Takadimi
Tarikita Tarikita
```

```
Nam - Takadimi
Nam - Nam - Takadimi
Nam - Nam - Nam - Takadimi
Tarikita Tarikita
```

From there, they recite all the same syllables, but in different orders creating different patterns. For example, if we notate the above structure in terms of the number of repetitions: `123`, then `321` would be:

```
Tha - Tha - Tha - Thakadimi
Tha - Tha - Thakadimi
Tha - Thakadimi
Tarikita Tarikita
```

So from these two possibilities ...

```
   Tha  Dhi  Thom  Nam
1. 123  123  123  123
2. 321  321  321  321
```

... there are a lot more possibilities that Manjunath and Skanda explore in their video:

```
3. 123 321 123 321
4. 321 123 321 123
5. 222 222 222 222
6. 111 222 333 123
7. 333 222 111 321
```

_Special thanks to B C Manjunath for sharing and explaining this pattern to me._

The above rhythm is a bit difficult to express in strudel! But here is an attempt:

<MiniRepl
  client:visible
  tune={`// "Konnakol exercise by Somashekar Jois via B C Manjunath and Skanda Manjunath" @by alex
// https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alJ_st3PkBk
samples('github:yaxu/mrid/main');

setcps(0.7)

let rhythm = (counts, drum) => 
  s_cat(counts.stepBind(count => s_cat(drum.s_extend(count), 
                                       "dhi thom thom dhi")),
        "tha tha:1 ka tha tha tha:1 ka tha"
       ).sound()

$: s_cat(
    rhythm("1 2 3", "tha -"),
    rhythm("1 2 3", "dhi -"),
    rhythm("1 2 3", "thom -"),
    rhythm("1 2 3", "nam -"),
).steps(8);

click: sound("hh\*2").bank("RolandTR808")
`}
dirt
/>

You might find it easier to <a href="https://strudel.cc/?znWJKOf2zMAL" target="_new">open this in the main strudel editor</a>.

If you click or clap along with the 'hh' (high hat) sound you should start to feel the rhythm move around, creating the feeling of syncopation when 'off-beats' are created. You could also try clapping using the gestures of the traditional <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nqo5Jlqvj_0&t=146s">eight-beat 'Adi Tala' cycle</a>.

You can try the different variations of the rhythm by editing the code in lines numbered 14-17 above, for example to try variation 7 (`333 222 111 321`), you would change the code to:

```
    rhythm("3 3 3", "tha -"),
    rhythm("2 2 2", "dhi -"),
    rhythm("1 1 1", "thom -"),
    rhythm("3 2 1", "nam -"),
```
