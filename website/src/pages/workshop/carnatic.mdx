# Getting Inspired by Carnatic Rhythms

Strudel (via its predecessor TidalCycles) is partly inspired by another system called the [Bol Processor](https://bolprocessor.org/), which was originally created to notate North Indian, Hindustani music of the _tabla_ drums. That's why Strudel likes to make you think in terms of rhythmic cycles which are prevalent in Indian music.

Algorithmic music has a particularly strong connection to _South_ Indian, Carnatic music traditions, which feature intricate rhythms featuring geometric patterns and numberical transformations.

Here's an example from Manjunath B C and his son Skanda:

This is in the _Konnakol_ tradition, where performers perform vocal rhythms using groups of syllables mostly related to the sounds of the mridangam drum. It goes fast, but they start with:

```
Ta Takadimi
Ta Ta Takadimi
Ta Ta Ta Takadimi
Tarikita Tarikita
```

Notice the repetition of 'Ta' increasing from 1 to 3. They then repeat with the `Ta` replaced with `Dhi`:

```
Dhi Takadimi
Dhi Dhi Takadimi
Dhi Dhi Dhi Takadimi
Tarikita Tarikita
```

Then do the same two more times, with `Thom` and then `Nam`.

From there, they recite all the same syllables, but in different orders creating different patterns. If you click or clap along you can feel the rhythm structures move around creating different syncopations, but the same groups of four always add up to 16 claps/clicks (this fits the Indian metrical concept of _Tala_, in this case the _Adi Tala_).
