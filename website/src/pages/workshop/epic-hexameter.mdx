# Getting Inspired by Epic Hexameter

Ancient Greek drama and poetry was originally sung and accompanied by dance and music. Unfortunately a lot of this rhythm is lost in translation and transmission of texts to the modern day, but we do know quite a lot about it.

Here's a nice video of [@lotos.lab](https://www.instagram.com/lotos.lab) and [@stefconnerssong](https://www.instagram.com/stefconnersong/) on Instagram doing a Roman practice routine designed to get you limber for performance of Greek tragic plays - this is the _oktokaidekasemos_ (an eighteen-beat rhythm):

# Greek metrical structures

- A _line_ is like a _cycle_ - it is made of a set number of feet
- A _foot_ is like a _step_ - it is made of several mora
- A _mora_ is like a _sub-step_ - short syllables take up one mora, long syllables take up two

## Some feet:

```
Short syllables: U
Long syllables:  -
3 morae:		4 morae:		5 morae:		6 morae:
U-		        --		        -U-		        -UU-
-U		        -UU		        U--		        UU--
UUU		        UU-		        (but not other combinations…)
```

# Epic hexamater

This is the metre found in Homeric Epic

- In general epic hexamater has 6 feet of 4 morae each line
- Feet are usually `-UU` (a dactyl) but can be `--` (a spondee)
- We don’t usually get a spondee in the 6th foot
- The 6th foot can also be shortened to `-U`, which is only 3 morae, giving our rhythm a bump
- The third foot can have a caesura (pause) in between the second and 3rd or 3rd and 4th morae
